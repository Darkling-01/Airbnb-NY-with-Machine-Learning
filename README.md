# Airbnb-NY-with-Machine-Learning

The project was created in Pycharm and connecting to my MySQL Workbench. This was a personal project design for me to get more familiar with using MySQL and Python and expand my knowledge in Machine Learning.

The folder 'Python Scripts' contains 3 files, the connection file (connection.py) which allows to connect to the dataset within the MySQL workbench.
The model.py file has the following: the data processing, removing irrelevant columns from the dataset, and spliting between the train and testing set, and implementing the linear regression model.
By training and testing the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), our measure of model quality (MAE) is 22.976, indicating that, on average, our model predictions are off by approximately $22,976.
